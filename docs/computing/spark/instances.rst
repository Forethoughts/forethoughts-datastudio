Managing cluster instances
===========================

Spark serverless doesn't really need complex management or maintenance of the Spark cluster.
Upgrading, scaling-out, optimization, and other complex tasks are handled automatically.
Enjoy **zero maintenance** serverless experience.

All you need to do is simple task, such as Start or Stop cluster instances when you need.

Cluster instance management operations can be done 
either programmatically using Python client library or with mouse clicks from `Instance management menu <https://staroid.com/g/open-datastudio/spark-serverless/instances>`_.
